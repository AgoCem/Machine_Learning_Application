## New End to End Machine Learning Project

Here I will show an end to end machine learning project from Data Ingestion to Model Evaluation

Firstly, I perform EDA and Model training on jupyter notebook, then when I'm sure of what I'm doing, I automate and generalise the model in order to be able to use it on other applications.

This is a simple regression problem.

# It is possible to take a look at the EDA that is performed in the notebook folder
