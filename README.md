## New End to End Machine Learning Project

Here I will show an end to end machine learning project with deployment

Firstly, I perform some EDA and model training on jupyter notebook, then when I'm sure of what I'm doing, I automate and generalise the model in order to be able to use it on other applications.

Once everything is done, I deploy it on AWS.
